Generative AI in Breast Cancer Detection by GANs for Image Genration
In Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), two key components exist: the generator and the discriminator. 
The generator's primary role is to create synthetic data samples, such as images or audio, to deceive the discriminator.
Conversely, the discriminator is tasked with discerning between authentic and fabricated samples. The generator and the discriminator 
function as neural networks engaged in a competitive interplay during the training phase. 
This iterative process is repeated multiple times, gradually refining the capabilities of the generator and discriminator with each iteration.
