# Generative AI in Breast Cancer Detection by GANs for Image Generation
In Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), two key components exist: the generator and the discriminator. 
The generator's primary role is to create synthetic data samples, such as images or audio, to deceive the discriminator.
Conversely, the discriminator is tasked with discerning between authentic and fabricated samples. The generator and the discriminator 
function as neural networks engaged in a competitive interplay during the training phase. 
This iterative process is repeated multiple times, gradually refining the capabilities of the generator and discriminator with each iteration.
GAN comprises two distinct phases:
## Part 1: Discriminator Training
 The Discriminator takes the lead while the Generator remains inactive. The Discriminator undergoes training on authentic data to identify and classify it as real accurately. Simultaneously, it is exposed to synthetic data generated by the Generator, aiming to discern and label these fabricated samples as fake correctly.
## Part 2: Generator Training
During this stage, the Generator takes center stage while the Discriminator takes a backseat. The Generator refines its strategy by leveraging the Discriminator's learning from the previously generated fake data. By incorporating the Discriminator's predictions, the Generator iteratively improves, attempting to create synthetic data that can increasingly deceive the Discriminator. This cyclical process enhances the Generator's capability to produce more convincing fake samples.
